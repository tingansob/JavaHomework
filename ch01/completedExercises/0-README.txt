Hello Professor,

I've completed all 16 of the exercises at the end of Chapter 01 and will be continuing to the Programming Projects in te comming week. I would appreciate it if you could look at the bundled files and let me know if I could have reduced redundancy with my use of static methods. I know there are other ways to get these examples done but I wanted to keep the work consistent with what we've done so far. 

To that end I've only used static methods and simple string printing. 

I look forward to discussing best practices with you.

Until class....
