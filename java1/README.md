Hello World,\
I'm creating this site to share my work with my fellow students. I'm trying to learn programming so that I can augment my skills as a System Administrator. If you stop by and read this leave me some notes...I'd love to hear from you.

I've written so much code that when I look back at it I am lost. I can see a direct need for well documented code, as well as making variables that are easy to understand and read, thus making it easy for revew.\
I add comments to all my work, I just fail to document more thoroughly. I had studied a bit of technical wirting while at Bloomberg and I do have a penchant for prose...\
Perhaps what I need to do is spend more time while creating my work adding comments that are more narrative and interesting so they provide the person following with quality information and useful directions. 

### The Audience 
It's just as important to know what to say as it is to know how to say it, but none of that is of any use if it's not useful to the reader. You have to know your audience.

- Who is my audience?
- What is my subject?
- What is the purpose of this documentation?
- What is the scope?
