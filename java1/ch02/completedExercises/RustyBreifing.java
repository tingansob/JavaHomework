Briefing Title

Customer:   WEMEUS                          
Champ:      Kevin George Rusty              
Date:       Fri Nov  3 13:33:16 EDT 2017    

Situation - Facts and figures. Verifiable. Style: Wikipedia. What is the state you are currently in? What do others need to know to get "the big picture?"

Purpose - What is the customer's purpose - why is the customer doing, what he is doing - part 1: external - part 2: internal. Use generic purpose, if purpose is not clear "x wants to delight y with z. And x wants to have a good time doing so.

Road Map - What initiatives are planned to pursue the purpose. What is planned now, what comes then, what comes later, what comes maybe.

Goals - Why is the customer coming to you? Try to keep this simple! Use the description as cycle title.

General Goals - What are the general goals? How is the project embedded? Where do you want to arrive in the long run?

Project Related Goals - Why are you coming to me? What part of the general goals should be covered by this project? What should be the ideal outcome from this project? Describe the ideal outcome (must be part of the general goals)

Scope - What are the parts of the cycle. What is the expected minimal scope? What resources (money, manpower, Online Tools) is the customer ready to make available (not including BrainStore's part). What are the deadlines?

Success Criteria - How do we measure the projects success. Only measurable parameters.
