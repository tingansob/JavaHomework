/*
 * APPENDIX 1
 *
 * Briefing 
 * Situation
 * 	Relevant facts and figures. Wikipedia style: who, when, what.
 * Purpose
 * 	What is the customer's purpose? Why is the customer doing what they're doing?
 * 	The why. The reason. The driver. The focus.
 * Road Map
 * 	What initiatives are planned to pursue the purpose?
 * 	What is planned now, what comes then, what comes later, What comes maybe?
 * Project Goals
 * 	Why is the customer coming to you?
 * 	Try to keep this simple. Only one topic!
 * Expected Results
 * 	What are the expected results?
 * 	What would the customer like to take home? Define the minimal scope.
 * 	It's better to exceed the minimal scope than to promise a lot and not keep your promise.
 * 	What resources (money, manpower, tools) is the customer ready to make available?
 * 	By when would the customer like the results?
 * Success Criteria
 * 	How do we measure the projects success?
