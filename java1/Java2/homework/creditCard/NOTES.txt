How do I create a complex card number. An int is too small for a 16 digit number and a I don't need any fractional part for a double. Most credit cards have card numbers broken into a series of 4/5 digit numbers seperated by a space. I know there's some algorhytm that allows for that unique number creation. Any suggestions? I created the app using a small ID number...starting with 1.
